users:
    create user DB
    create user OOP system
    add id and username to each user

design:
    opening page
    login page
    friends page
    messaging page
    profile page
    settings page
    other user profile page

server:
    websocket setup
    client to client communication through the server
    encrypt each message and decrypt
    store encyrpted messages to:
        object
        DB
    ***
    Each message is sent to DB (or obj for now):
         client updates every .1s to check for update
         if update:
              updates messages
         else: nothing
